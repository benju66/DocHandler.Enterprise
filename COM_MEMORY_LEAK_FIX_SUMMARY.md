# COM Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

### Original Issues
1. **COM Object Leaks**: Word/Excel COM objects not being released after use
2. **Memory Growth**: Continuous memory growth from 174MB to 294MB+ over time
3. **Long-lived Office Instances**: Session-aware services kept COM objects alive indefinitely
4. **Incomplete Cleanup**: Queue processing never reached cleanup code

### Root Causes
1. Session-aware Office services held COM objects for entire app lifetime
2. SaveQuotesQueueService ran in continuous loop, never calling FinishBatch()
3. Pre-warming created unnecessary COM objects at startup
4. No health monitoring to detect and recover from leaks

## Solution Overview

### 1. New Batch-Scoped Converter: `ReliableOfficeConverter`
- Creates Office instances only when needed
- Reuses instances within a batch (limited scope)
- Properly disposes after batch completion
- Includes process tracking for orphaned process cleanup

### 2. Updated Queue Processing
- Modified `SaveQuotesQueueService` to complete when queue is empty
- Ensures `FinishBatch()` is always called in finally block
- Added proper disposal and cancellation support
- Fixed the infinite loop issue

### 3. Enhanced Cleanup Process
- Added 500ms delay after Word.Quit() for proper shutdown
- Retry mechanism for Word process registration (Hwnd availability)
- Proper disposal chain in MainViewModel
- Force cleanup of idle session-aware services after queue

### 4. Health Monitoring
- `OfficeHealthMonitor` tracks COM objects and memory
- Automatic recovery when thresholds exceeded
- `OfficeProcessGuard` tracks and kills orphaned processes
- Process termination on app shutdown

### 5. Removed Pre-warming
- Eliminated startup COM object creation
- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster application startup

## Key Code Changes

### ReliableOfficeConverter
```csharp
public class ReliableOfficeConverter : IDisposable
{
    // Batch-scoped lifecycle
    // Proper COM cleanup in CleanupWord/CleanupExcel
    // Process tracking for orphaned process cleanup
}
```

### SaveQuotesQueueService
```csharp
// Changed from infinite loop to completion when empty
while (!_cancellationTokenSource.Token.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    if (_queue.TryDequeue(out var item)) { ... }
    else if (tasks.Count == 0)
    {
        // Queue is empty and all tasks completed
        break; // Exit loop!
    }
}
```

### MainViewModel.Cleanup
```csharp
// Enhanced cleanup with proper order
1. Stop queue processing
2. Dispose services in dependency order
3. Force COM cleanup
4. Terminate orphaned Office processes
```

## Results

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **PDF Processing**: No COM leaks (Created: 1, Released: 1, Net: 0)
2. **Queue Completion**: Properly exits and calls cleanup
3. **Process Tracking**: Orphaned processes killed on shutdown
4. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic recovery from leaks

### ⚠️ Remaining Considerations
1. **Shutdown Timing**: Word cleanup needs ~2 seconds to complete
2. **Memory Warnings**: May be managed .NET memory, not COM leaks
3. **Process Registration**: Hwnd not always immediately available

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify COM Cleanup**
   - Process multiple Word/Excel files
   - Check COM statistics after queue completion
   - Verify no orphaned processes remain

2. **Monitor Memory**
   - Track working set over extended usage
   - Differentiate between managed and unmanaged memory
   - Verify garbage collection effectiveness

3. **Stress Testing**
   - Queue 50+ documents of various types
   - Mix Word, Excel, and PDF files
   - Verify cleanup after each batch

## Future Improvements

1. **Async Cleanup**: Make cleanup methods async for better shutdown handling
2. **Configurable Timeouts**: Allow adjustment of cleanup delays
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed COM lifecycle tracking
4. **Memory Profiling**: Integrate with performance counters
